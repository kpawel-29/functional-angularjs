# functional-angularjs-seed

Seed project allowing building angularjs apps in more functional way.

Used technologies :
 - AngularJS 1.6.x
 - angular-material
 - Redux
 - Typescript 2.x
 - Webpack 2.x
 - Jest
 - SCSS
 
## Why Do I Need This?

If you have enough: 
 - poor ES5 syntax, dynamic weak typing - That's why I used Typescript
 - feeling lost when and why you app state is change - That's why I used Redux, and promotes writing code to more functional way
 - low reuse code, building common components from zero - That's why I used angular-material and promotes components architecture
 - tons of testing environment, long time test execution - That's why I used Jest 
  
## How do i use it
`npm install` - install all packages

`npm run test` - run test

`npm run test:watch` - run test in watch mode

`npm run build` - build production bundle

`npm run watch` - run develop mode server

## More info
Project is connected with [redux devtool extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/)
For connection angular with redux used [ng-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/ng-redux)
